In this notebook I will be analysing data from the P2P lending marketplace "Prosper" (https://www.prosper.com/ ), in order to get an insight into which loans, borrowers and variables affecting likelihood of default.  The dataset contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others.
